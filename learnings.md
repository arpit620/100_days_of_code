Challenges: 
- While using CoPilot Org version : Sorry, the response matched public code so it was blocked. Please rephrase your prompt.
- CoPilot Edits do not support folder specific prompts
    - Zed.dev doesn't have this problem. But it can't auto write files
- Can we create system prompt that all follow up questions will be around Python flask so we don't have to keep repeating it?
