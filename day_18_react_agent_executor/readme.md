### Mistral AI is giving error. Needs to be resolved.

langchain_core.exceptions.OutputParserException: Parsing LLM output produced both a final answer and a parse-able action:: To determine the length of the word "DOG," I need to count the number of characters in the word.


### Added Github model
With Github model, its working on server but not on local. Need a fix for that.
